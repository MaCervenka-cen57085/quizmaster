# IMPORTANT: In production, the encryption key MUST be set via environment variable
# Do NOT use the default key in production!
# Set QUIZMASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable to a secure 32-character string

# Example of how to set in production:
# export QUIZMASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-secure-32-character-key-here"

# The application will fail to start if the key is not properly configured
